# Description

# Assumptions
## General
- '&' and ';' always occur in special sense.
- Absolute file paths always begin with a '/' for example "/Users/vinitmehta/desktop/abcd"
- In the warp command if multiple commands are given separated by space ex: "warp .. test" then the complete command is saved in pastevents.
## Warp
- File path does not contain any spaces.
